This project is a to do list API. It currently retrieves a csv to do list and returns it as JSON.
Users can also add a new task through an HTML form. 
The new task is added to the JSON that is returned and the CSV file is updated accordingly.

To create this app - I used HTML, JavaScript, and Python (w/ Flask and Pandas modules)
