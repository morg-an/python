This project aims to create my first API in the form of a to do list. It currently retrieves csv data and returns as JSON.
Users can also add a new task through an HTML form. At the present, that new task is incorporated into the JSON. 
Still remaining - I need to update the CSV file with the new JSON to incorporate the new tasks as they are added.
