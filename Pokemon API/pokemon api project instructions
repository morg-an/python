Advanced usecase, using apis, fetching data and producing results.

Pokemon is a big game series that have several games and almost 900 pokemon exists in those games.

But it all started on generation 1 called Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue, in total only 151 pokemon existed in 1996.

This game is so popular that there is an api for all it's data : https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#info

A pokemon is a creature that have some attributes.
All pokemons have
id:1
name: Bulbasaur
types: grass and poision (can be one or more)

Another one:
id:4
name: charmander
types: fire

There are more attributes for each pokemon but for this task only the above ones are interesting.

using the pokeapi we can go to this website : https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/4 to see all data about Charmander.
If we want a list of 10 first pokemons we can go to https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=10


Task:
Figure out all the different types that existed in the first game, that is the first 151 pokemons and print it as a list.
example: normal, fighting, flying, poision, ground etc.

Bonus task:
For all the different types found, create a file for each type that contains a list of all pokemon that have that type.
example:
filename: fire.json
[
	{
		id:4,
		name: "charmander"
	},
	{
		id:37,
		name: "vulpix"
	},
]

Hints:
To be able to solve this task there is a few concepts that might be new that you need to know about.

API:
	Apis are basically datapoints where you ask for something and might get something in return.
	It has a few actions like GET, POST, DELETE.
	GET is used if you want information from the api, like the above pokemon api, you just want to see the data.
	POST is used to send information to the api, like if you update your name on a website a POST is used to send the new name to the server so it can be updated in the database.
	DELETE is for deleting information, if you want to remove your profile from a website or app
	In your case you need to figure out how to make an GET request towards the pokeapi in python.
	
JSON:
	"JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and arrays. It is a common data format with diverse uses in electronic data interchange, including that of web applications with servers." -wikipedia
	If you go to https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/4/ you will be able to see the data but it looks a bit chaotic even though it is actually readable.
	The data is structured in a format called JSON which makes it easy to work with, and today most api both return JSON and expect data to be sent in JSON.
	It makes a lot more sense formatted which your browser might or might not do automatically, if not there is a tool for it https://jsonformatter.org/ go there and paste all the data from the above api and you will see a structure that looks a bit like this:
	{
		"abilities": [
			{
				"ability": {
				"name": "blaze",
				"url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/66/"
				},
				"is_hidden": false,
				"slot": 1
			}
		]
	}
	What does this mean?
	there is a KEY called "abilities", that contains a list of OBJECTS, each of these OBJECTS have the following KEYs "ability" that contains another object with KEYs "name" and "url", "is_hidden" and "slot"
	so since "abilities" is a list you could loop on it, and foreach of the objects you could check the values by asking for the different KEYS.
	like ability.name would return "blaze", ability.slot would return 1 etc.
	Python should have good support for this built in.
	
	So to get started:
	GET from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=10
	from this you will get a list with name and a url.
	for each of those do another GET to the url(like https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/) to get the pokemons data.
	in that data there is a KEY for type, find it and save the type somewhere, make sure that you don't save duplicates of types.
	if the pokemon have multiple types make sure to catch em all.
	then print the list of types.
